College Ka minor project time is kum

Thinking:
Lets do like this, Identify the objects in frame Obstacles for now (Will focus on coins later)
And give info in this kind of format [CLASSES of Obs like Half barricade, full etc] in a list
of 3 elements and give this to AI if this works. Cause I don't have much time right now busy with
some stuff lets use Reinforcement Learning for this.

LESSS GOOOOOOOOO


Plan:
- [] Train Yolo Model for Obstacles Tracking
- [] Identify Score (OCR will do) Or Lets Track time thats better
